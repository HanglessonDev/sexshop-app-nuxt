## Commit Messages

This project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-customizable) to standardize commit messages. We recommend replacing the `build-commit.js` file from the `cz-customizable` module with a custom configuration to better suit your needs.

### Recommended Files

1. **Replace the `build-commit.js` file located in `node_modules/cz-customizable/lib/` with the following file:**

   - **`build-commit.js`**: [Click here to access the configuration file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HanglessonDev/20e0be1a5c5384b233c5f9b7a1a6cf28/raw/2fa7e0d6e8329c36abce63343da0336cb5578199/build-commit.js)

   This file customizes how commits are processed and managed.

2. **Update the Commitizen configuration file with the following:**

   - **`cz-config.cjs`**: [Click here to access the configuration file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HanglessonDev/20e0be1a5c5384b233c5f9b7a1a6cf28/raw/0b5a5fe1c2dde9e8ddd5ab88e494d387598cb942/cz-config.cjs)

   This file defines the rules and style for your commit messages.

### How to Replace the File

1. **Locate the `build-commit.js` file** in `node_modules/cz-customizable/lib/`.
2. **Replace the content** of this file with the content from the provided `build-commit.js` file.
3. **Ensure that the `cz-config.cjs` file** is present at the root of your project or in the directory specified in `package.json` so that Commitizen can find and use it correctly.

### How to Use

After replacing the file and updating the configuration file, use the following command to create a commit:

```bash
npm run commit
```

## Testing

- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Run `npm run test` to execute unit and integration tests with Vitest.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Use Playwright for end-to-end testing.

## Git Hooks

Husky and lint-staged are set up to run linting and formatting checks before commits. Ensure your code passes these checks before committing.
